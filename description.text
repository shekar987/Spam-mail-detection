Code provides:

--- Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Imports necessary libraries including NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn modules.
Reads email data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame (raw_mail_data).
Replaces null values in the DataFrame with empty strings.

---Labeling and Data Separation:
Labels spam emails as 0 and ham (non-spam) emails as 1.
Separates the data into features (X, representing the 'Message' column) and labels (Y, representing the 'Category' column).

---Train-Test Split:
Splits the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

---Text Vectorization:
Utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into feature vectors.
Transforms the training and test text data into numerical feature representations.

---Logistic Regression Model:
Initializes a Logistic Regression model.
Trains the model using the training features (X_train_features) and labels (Y_train).

---Model Evaluation:
Predicts labels for both the training and test datasets.
Calculates and prints the accuracy of the model on both the training and test data.

---Prediction on New Input:
Takes a new email input for prediction.
Converts the input text into feature vectors using the TF-IDF vectorizer.
Uses the trained Logistic Regression model to predict whether the input email is spam or ham.
Prints the prediction result.

Overall, the code demonstrates a basic email spam classification workflow using logistic regression and TF-IDF vectorization.
It involves data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions on new input data.
